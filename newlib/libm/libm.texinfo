@chapter Reentrancy Properties of @code{libm}

@cindex reentrancy
@cindex @code{matherr} and reentrancy
When a libm function detects an exceptional case, @code{errno} may be
set, the @code{matherr} function may be called, and a error message 
may be written to the standard error stream.  This behavior may not
be reentrant.

@c The exact behavior depends on the currently selected error handling 
@c mode (IEEE, POSIX, X/Open, or SVID).

With reentrant C libraries like the Cygnus C library, @code{errno} is
a macro which expands to the per-thread error value.  This makes it thread
safe.

When the user provides his own @code{matherr} function it must be
reentrant for the math library as a whole to be reentrant.

In normal debugged programs, there are usually no math subroutine
errors---and therefore no assignments to @code{errno} and no @code{matherr}
calls; in that situation, the math functions behave reentrantly.
