.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getaddrinfo
function is defined for protocol-independent nodename-to-address translation.
It performs the functionality of
.Xr gethostbyname 3
and
.Xr getservbyname 3 ,
but in a more sophisticated manner.
.Pp
The
.Li addrinfo
structure is defined as a result of including the
.Aq Pa netdb.h
header:
.Bd -literal -offset
struct addrinfo {
     int     ai_flags;     /* AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, AI_NUMERICHOST */
     int     ai_family;    /* PF_xxx */
     int     ai_socktype;  /* SOCK_xxx */
     int     ai_protocol;  /* 0 or IPPROTO_xxx for IPv4 and IPv6 */
     size_t  ai_addrlen;   /* length of ai_addr */
     char   *ai_canonname; /* canonical name for nodename */
     struct sockaddr  *ai_addr; /* binary address */
     struct addrinfo  *ai_next; /* next structure in linked list */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa nodename
and
.Fa servname
arguments are pointers to null-terminated strings or
.Dv NULL .
One or both of these two arguments must be a
.Pf non Dv -NULL
pointer.
In the normal client scenario, both the
.Fa nodename
and
.Fa servname
are specified.
In the normal server scenario, only the
.Fa servname
is specified.
A
.Pf non Dv -NULL
.Fa nodename
string can be either a node name or a numeric host address string
(i.e., a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or an IPv6 hex address).
A
.Pf non Dv -NULL
.Fa servname
string can be either a service name or a decimal port number.
.Pp
The caller can optionally pass an
.Li addrinfo
structure, pointed to by the third argument,
to provide hints concerning the type of socket that the caller supports.
In this
.Fa hints
structure all members other than
.Fa ai_flags ,
.Fa ai_family ,
.Fa ai_socktype ,
and
.Fa ai_protocol
must be zero or a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
A value of
.Dv PF_UNSPEC
for
.Fa ai_family
means the caller will accept any protocol family.
A value of 0 for
.Fa ai_socktype
means the caller will accept any socket type.
A value of 0 for
.Fa ai_protocol
means the caller will accept any protocol.
For example, if the caller handles only TCP and not UDP, then the
.Fa ai_socktype
member of the hints structure should be set to
.Dv SOCK_STREAM
when
.Fn getaddrinfo
is called.
If the caller handles only IPv4 and not IPv6, then the
.Fa ai_family
member of the
.Fa hints
structure should be set to
.Dv PF_INET
when
.Fn getaddrinfo
is called.
If the third argument to
.Fn getaddrinfo
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, this is the same as if the caller had filled in an
.Li addrinfo
structure initialized to zero with
.Fa ai_family
set to
.Dv PF_UNSPEC .
.Pp
Upon successful return a pointer to a linked list of one or more
.Li addrinfo
structures is returned through the final argument.
The caller can process each
.Li addrinfo
structure in this list by following the
.Fa ai_next
pointer, until a
.Dv NULL
pointer is encountered.
In each returned
.Li addrinfo
structure the three members
.Fa ai_family ,
.Fa ai_socktype ,
and
.Fa ai_protocol
are the corresponding arguments for a call to the
.Fn socket
function.
In each
.Li addrinfo
structure the
.Fa ai_addr
member points to a filled-in socket address structure whose length is
specified by the
.Fa ai_addrlen
member.
.Pp
If the
.Dv AI_PASSIVE
bit is set in the
.Fa ai_flags
member of the
.Fa hints
structure, then the caller plans to use the returned socket address
structure in a call to
.Fn bind .
In this case, if the
.Fa nodename
argument is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, then the IP address portion of the socket
address structure will be set to
.Dv INADDR_ANY
for an IPv4 address or
.Dv IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT
for an IPv6 address.
.Pp
If the
.Dv AI_PASSIVE
bit is not set in the
.Fa ai_flags
member of the
.Fa hints
structure, then the returned socket address structure will be ready for a
call to
.Fn connect
(for a connection-oriented protocol)
or either
.Fn connect ,
.Fn sendto ,
or
.Fn sendmsg
(for a connectionless protocol).
In this case, if the
.Fa nodename
argument is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, then the IP address portion of the
socket address structure will be set to the loopback address.
.Pp
If the
.Dv AI_CANONNAME
bit is set in the
.Fa ai_flags
member of the
.Fa hints
structure, then upon successful return the
.Fa ai_canonname
member of the first
.Li addrinfo
structure in the linked list will point to a null-terminated string
containing the canonical name of the specified
.Fa nodename .
.Pp
If the
.Dv AI_NUMERICHOST
bit is set in the
.Fa ai_flags
member of the
.Fa hints
structure, then a
.Pf non Dv -NULL
.Fa nodename
string must be a numeric host address string.
Otherwise an error of
.Dv EAI_NONAME
is returned.
This flag prevents any type of name resolution service (e.g., the DNS)
from being called.
.Pp
The arguments to
.Fn getaddrinfo
must be sufficiently consistent and unambiguous.
Here are some problem cases you may encounter:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Fn getaddrinfo
will fail if the members in the
.Fa hints
structure are not consistent.
For example, for internet address families,
.Fn getaddrinfo
will fail if you specify
.Dv SOCK_STREAM
to
.Fa ai_socktype
while you specify
.Dv IPPROTO_UDP
to
.Fa ai_protocol .
.It
If you specify a
.Fa servname
which is defined only for certain
.Fa ai_socktype ,
.Fn getaddrinfo
will fail because the arguments are not consistent.
For example,
.Fn getaddrinfo
will return an error if you ask for
.Dq Li tftp
service on
.Dv SOCK_STREAM .
.It
For internet address families, if you specify
.Fa servname
while you set
.Fa ai_socktype
to
.Dv SOCK_RAW ,
.Fn getaddrinfo
will fail, because service names are not defined for the internet
.Dv SOCK_RAW
space.
.It
If you specify numeric
.Fa servname ,
while leaving
.Fa ai_socktype
and
.Fa ai_protocol
unspecified,
.Fn getaddrinfo
will fail.
This is because the numeric
.Fa servname
does not identify any socket type, and
.Fn getaddrinfo
is not allowed to glob the argument in such case.
.El
.Pp
All of the information returned by
.Fn getaddrinfo
is dynamically allocated:
the
.Li addrinfo
structures, the socket address structures, and canonical node name
strings pointed to by the addrinfo structures.
To return this information to the system the function
.Fn freeaddrinfo
is called.
The
.Fa addrinfo
structure pointed to by the
.Fa ai argument
is freed, along with any dynamic storage pointed to by the structure.
This operation is repeated until a
.Dv NULL
.Fa ai_next
pointer is encountered.
.Pp
To aid applications in printing error messages based on the
.Dv EAI_xxx
codes returned by
.Fn getaddrinfo ,
.Fn gai_strerror
is defined.
The argument is one of the
.Dv EAI_xxx
values defined earlier and the return value points to a string describing
the error.
If the argument is not one of the
.Dv EAI_xxx
values, the function still returns a pointer to a string whose contents
indicate an unknown error.
.\"
.Sh EXTENSIONS
This implementation supports numeric IPv6 address notation with the
experimental scope identifier.
By appending a percent sign and scope identifier to the address, you
can specify the value of the
.Li sin6_scope_id
field of the socket address.
This makes management of scoped address easier,
and allows cut-and-paste input of scoped addresses.
.Pp
At the moment the code supports only link-local addresses in this format.
The scope identifier is hardcoded to name of hardware interface associated
with the link,
(such as
.Li ne0 ) .
For example,
.Dq Li fe80::1%ne0 ,
which means
.Do
.Li fe80::1
on the link associated with the
.Li ne0
interface
.Dc .
.Pp
This implementation is still very experimental and non-standard.
The current implementation assumes a one-to-one relationship between
interfaces and links, which is not necessarily true according to the
specification.
.\"
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code tries to connect to
.Dq Li www.kame.net
service
.Dq Li http .
via stream socket.
It loops through all the addresses available, regardless of the address family.
If the destination resolves to an IPv4 address, it will use an
.Dv AF_INET
socket.
Similarly, if it resolves to IPv6, an
.Dv AF_INET6
socket is used.
Observe that there is no hardcoded reference to particular address family.
The code works even if
.Fn getaddrinfo
returns addresses that are not IPv4/v6.

.Fa servname

.Pp
If called with an appropriate argument,
.Fn gai_strerror
returns a pointer to a string describing the given error code.
If the argument is not one of the

indicate an unknown error.
