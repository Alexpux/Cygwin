1. newlib/iconv/ccs/iconv_mktbl Perl script should be upgraded. Currently 
   this script can only generate Big Endian (Network Byte Order) .cct files.
   This decreases conversion performance on little endian systems since iconv 
   library needs to swap all bytes that it reads from loaded CCS table.
   Something such -LE and -BE options should be added to 'iconv_mktbl' script.

   Also, we can keep two .cct file versions - BE and LE (e.g., koi8_r-le.cct
   and koi8_r-be.cct) and iconv library will automatically choose needed cct.

   Or we can keep both LE and BE data in one .cct file.

2. http://www.dante.net/staff/konstantin/FreeBSD/iconv/ contains additional
   CES and CCS converters (see iconv-extra-2.0.tar.gz and 
   iconv-rfc1345-2.0.tar.gz). These extra converters should be added too.

3. Documentation should be created. It should contain:
   1) How to compile iconv (configure script options description)
   2) How to add new converter
   3) Work principles.
   It would be nice if iconv architecture will be described too.

4. CCS files loading (iconv/lib/loaddata.c). Now file is loaded into memory
   for every iconv descriptor. For example, if one use two iconv descriptors
   for UTF8->KOI8-R and UTF-16->KOI8-R conversions, koi8_r.cct file will
   be loaded twice. To save memory, we should load each .cct only once 
   (if possible).

5. UTF-16 converter supports only Big Endian UTF-16. BOM (Byte Order Mark)
   isn't supported too. UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE CES support should be added.
   BOM Support should be added. The same is for UCS4 and UCS2 encodings.
   
6. iconv tests should be written and added to Newlib tests suite.
