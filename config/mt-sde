# We default to building libraries optimised for size.  We switch off
# sibling-call optimization to permit interlinking of MIPS16 and
# non-MIPS16 functions.  The -mcode-xonly option allows MIPS16 libraries
# to run on Harvard-style split I/D memories, so long as they have the
# D-to-I redirect for PC-relative loads.  -mno-gpopt has two purposes:
# it allows libraries to be used in situations where $gp != our _gp,
# and it allows them to be built with -G8 while retaining link compability
# with -G0 and -G4.
