 * CRTinit.c
 *
 * A dummy version of _CRT_INIT for MS compatibility. Programs, or more often
 * dlls, which use the static version of the MSVC run time are supposed to
 * call _CRT_INIT to initialize the run time library in DllMain. This does
 * not appear to be necessary when using crtdll or the dll versions of the
 * MSVC runtime, so the dummy call simply does nothing.
