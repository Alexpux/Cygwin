; Exports from the runtime except that these exports are actually preceeded
; by a underscore in the actual DLL. These correspond to functions which
; are non-ANSI and were prefixed with an underscore to avoid name space
; clutter. However many, in fact most programs still use a few of these
; functions without the underscore. This .def file is specially processed
; to make those non-underscored name function calls call the equivalent
; underscored functions.
