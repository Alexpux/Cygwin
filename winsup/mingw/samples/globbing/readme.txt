
This directory contains samples which demonstrate default (globbing on)
behavior, how to turn the globbing off with the _CRT_glob variable, and
how to turn it off with the CRT_noglob object file.

Run jam and then run glob, noglob and CRTnoglob with an argument like
*.* to see the difference.
