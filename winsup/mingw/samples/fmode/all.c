/*
 * A sample program demonstrating how to use _CRT_fmode to change the default
 * file opening mode to binary AND change stdin, stdout and stderr. Redirect
 * stdout to a file from the command line to see the difference.
 *
 * Also try directing a file into stdin. If you type into stdin you will get
 * \r\n at the end of every line... unlike UNIX. But at least if you
 * redirect a file in you will get exactly the characters in the file as input.
 *
 * THIS CODE IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
