/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify how identifiers are imported from a DLL.

   __DECLSPEC_SUPPORTED    Defined if dllimport attribute is supported.
   __MINGW_IMPORT          The attribute definition to specify imported
                           variables/functions. 
   __MINGW32_VERSION       Runtime version.
   __MINGW32_MAJOR_VERSION Runtime major version.
   __MINGW32_MINOR_VERSION Runtime minor version.
   __MINGW32_BUILD_DATE    Runtime build date.
   
   Other macros:

   __int64                 define to be long long. Using a typedef can
                           tweak bugs in the C++ parser.
  
   All headers should include this first, and then use __DECLSPEC_SUPPORTED
   to choose between the old ``__imp__name'' style or __MINGW_IMPORT
   style declarations.  */
