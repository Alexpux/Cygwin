     a stale pointer into demapped memory space if the DLL is unloaded
     by a call to dlclose, we prevent this happening for dynamically
     loaded DLLS in dlopen by saving and restoring cxx_malloc around
     the call to LoadLibrary, which invokes the DLL's startup sequence.
     Modern DLLs won't even attempt to override the pointer when loaded
     statically, but will write their overrides directly into the
     struct it points to.  With all modern DLLs, this will remain the
     default_cygwin_cxx_malloc struct in cxx.cc, but if any broken DLLs
     are in the mix they will have overridden the pointer and subsequent
     overrides will go into their embedded cxx_malloc structs.  This is
     almost certainly not a problem as they can never be unloaded, but
     if we ever did want to do anything about it, we could check here to
     see if the pointer had been altered in the early parts of the DLL's
     startup, and if so copy back the new overrides and reset it here.
     However, that's just a note for the record; at the moment, we can't
