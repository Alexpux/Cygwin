/* FIXME: this delqueue module is very flawed and should be rewritten.
	First, having an array of a fixed size for keeping track of the
	unlinked but not yet deleted files is bad.  Second, some programs
	will unlink files and then create a new one in the same location
	and this behavior is not supported in the current code.  Probably
	we should find a move/rename function that will work on open files,
	and move delqueue files to some special location or some such
	hack... */
