/* Cygwin versioning is relatively complicated because of its status
   as a shared library.  Let's start with how versioning used to be done.

   Historical versioning in Cygwin 16.0 to 19.5:

   In the olden days of Cygwin, we had a dll major and minor version
   and a registry version.  The major number started at 16 because the
   "b15" GNU-Win32 release of the compiler tools was out when this
   scheme was started.  We incremented the DLL name frequently (for
   every official release) and towards the end of this period every
   release used a different shared memory area to prevent DLLs from
   interfering with each other (embedding a build timestamp into the
   name of the shared memory area).  This turned out to be a Bad Idea
   (tm) because people needed to mingle separate releases and have
   them work together more than we thought they would.  This was
   especially problematic when tty info needed to be retained when an
   old Cygwin executable executed a newer one.

   In the old scheme, we incremented the major number whenever a
   change to the dll invalidated existing executables.  This can
   happen for a number of reasons, including when functions are
   removed from the export list of the dll.  The minor number was
   incremented when a change was made that we wanted to record, but
   that didn't invalidate existing executables.  Both numbers were
   recorded in the executable and in the dll.

   In October 1998 (starting with Cygwin 19.6), we started a new
   means of Cygwin versioning: */

      /* The DLL major and minor numbers correspond to the "version of
	 the Cygwin library".  This version is used to track important
	 changes to the DLL and is mainly informative in nature. */

  /* The current cygwin version is 1.3.1 */

#define CYGWIN_VERSION_DLL_MAJOR 1003
#define CYGWIN_VERSION_DLL_MINOR 3

      /* Major numbers before CYGWIN_VERSION_DLL_EPOCH are
	 incompatible. */

#define CYGWIN_VERSION_DLL_EPOCH 19

      /* CYGWIN_VERSION_DLL_COMBINED gives us a single number
	 representing the combined DLL major and minor numbers. */

      /* WATCH OUT FOR OCTAL!  Don't use, say, "00020" for 0.20 */
