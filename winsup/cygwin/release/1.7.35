What's new:
-----------

- New APIs: cabsl, cimagl, creall, finitel, hypotl, sqrtl.


What changed:
-------------

- Performance improvements of the new account DB handling.

- Since 1.7.34, chmod does not always affect the POSIX permission mask as
  returned by stat(2) or printed by ls(1), due to the improved POSIX ACL
  handling.  However, that's still far from perfect, so, as a temporary
  workaround, chmod now checks if secondary groups and users in the ACL
  have more permissions than the primary group.  If so, the permissions
  of the secondary users and groups will be reduced according to the mask
  given by the new primary group permissions.  I.e, chmod 600 will remove
  all permissions from the primary group as well as all secondary user and
  group entries in the ACL.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix /proc/cpuinfo multicore info on Intel CPUs.

- Generate unique inode number for /dev/tty under all circumstances.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2015-02/msg00211.html

- Fix handling of PATH search in execlp and other calls to honor mount flags.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2015-02/msg00119.html

- Remove a debug message accidentally printed to the terminal window
  if an application calls fcntl(F_SETFL) erroneously.

- Two regressions in 1.7.34 acl(SETACL, ...):

  - SETACL overwrote the incoming acltent_t array for bookkeeping purposes
    while iterating over its entries.  This broke reusing the acl in the
    calling application (e.g. setfacl).
    Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2015-02/msg00304.html

  - SETACL accidentally missed to grant owner FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES access.

- 64 bit: Avoid misbehaviour in signal mask computation.

- Avoid data loss on non-blocking pipes after switching back to blocking.

- Fix a potential heap corruption in mkgroup and mkpasswd when enumerating
  Unix users.
