What's new:
-----------

- Introduce reading passwd/group entries directly from SAM/AD, thus allowing
  to do without /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf
  file to configure passwd/group handling.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Don't hang in accept calls if socket is no listener.  Set errno to EINVAL
  instead.  Don't hang in read/recv/recvfrom/recvmsg calls if socket is
  connection oriented and not connected.  Set errno to ENOTCONN instead.

- Don't claim serial line is a tty.  Don't allow seeking on serial lines and
  sockets.  Set errno to ESPIPE instead.
