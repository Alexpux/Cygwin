What's new:
-----------

- Introduce reading passwd/group entries directly from SAM/AD, thus allowing
  to do without /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf
  file to configure passwd/group handling.

- /proc/cygdrive as a symlink pointing to the current cygdrive prefix.  This
  can be utilized in scripts to access paths via cygdrive prefix, even if the
  cygdrive prefix has been changed by the user.

- Extend /proc/partitions to print the windows mount points the device is
  mounted on.  This allows to recognize the underlying Windows devices of the
  Cygwin raw device names.

- New API: quotactl, designed after the Linux/BSD function, but severly
  restricted:  Windows only supports user block quotas on NTFS, no group
  quotas, no inode quotas, no time constraints.

Bug Fixes
---------

- Don't hang in accept calls if socket is no listener.  Set errno to EINVAL
  instead.  Don't hang in read/recv/recvfrom/recvmsg calls if socket is
  connection oriented and not connected.  Set errno to ENOTCONN instead.

- Don't claim serial line is a tty.  Don't allow seeking on serial lines and
  sockets.  Set errno to ESPIPE instead.
