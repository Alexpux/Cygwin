What's new:
-----------

- Cygwin can now generate passwd/group entries directly from Windows
  user databases (local SAM or Active Directory), thus allowing to run
  Cygwin without having to create /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.
  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf file to configure passwd/group handling.

  For bordercase which require to use /etc/passwd and /etc/group files,
  change mkpasswd/mkgroup to generate passwd/group entries compatible
  with the entries read from SAM/AD.

- /proc/cygdrive is a new symlink pointing to the current cygdrive prefix.
  This can be utilized in scripts to access paths via cygdrive prefix, even
  if the cygdrive prefix has been changed by the user.

- /proc/partitions now prints the windows mount points the device is mounted
  on.  This allows to recognize the underlying Windows devices of the Cygwin
  raw device names.

- New API: quotactl, designed after the Linux/BSD function, but severly
  restricted:  Windows only supports user block quotas on NTFS, no group
  quotas, no inode quotas, no time constraints.

- New APIs: ffsl, ffsll (glibc extensions).


What changed:
-------------

- New internal exception handling based on SEH on 64 bit Cygwin.

- Revamp Solaris ACL implementation to more closely work like POSIX ACLs
  are supposed to work.  Finally implement a CLASS_OBJ emulation.  Update
  getfacl(1)/setfacl(1) accordingly.

- Drop the current working directory from the default DLL search path in
  favor of Cygwin's /bin dir.

- Improve various header files for C++- and standards-compliance.

- Doug Lea malloc implementation update from 2.8.3 to the latest 2.8.6.

- Don't hang in accept calls if socket is no listener.  Set errno to EINVAL
  instead.  Don't hang in read/recv/recvfrom/recvmsg calls if socket is
  connection oriented and not connected.  Set errno to ENOTCONN instead.

- Don't allow seeking on serial lines and sockets.  Set errno to ESPIPE
  instead.
