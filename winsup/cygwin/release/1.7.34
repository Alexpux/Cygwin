What's new:
-----------

- Cygwin can now generate passwd/group entries directly from Windows
  user databases (local SAM or Active Directory), thus allowing to run
  Cygwin without having to create /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.
  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf file to configure passwd/group handling.

  For bordercase which require to use /etc/passwd and /etc/group files,
  change mkpasswd/mkgroup to generate passwd/group entries compatible
  with the entries read from SAM/AD.

- Add -b/--remove-all option to setfacl to reduce the ACL to only the
  entries representing POSIX permission bits.

- Provide Cygwin documentation (PDFs and HTML) for offline usage in
  /usr/share/doc/cygwin-${version}.


What changed:
-------------

- Revamp Solaris ACL implementation to more closely work like POSIX ACLs
  are supposed to work.  Finally implement a CLASS_OBJ emulation.  Update
  getfacl(1)/setfacl(1) accordingly.

- The xdr functions are no longer exported for newly built executables.
  Use libtirpc-devel instead.
