What changed:
-------------

- Slightly improve randomness of /dev/random emulation.

- Allow to use advisory locking on any device which is backed by an OS
  handle.  Right now this excludes /dev/clipboard, /dev/dsp, as well as
  almost all virtual files under /proc.

- Properly set process sid rather than always using -1.
