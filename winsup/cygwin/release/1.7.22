What changed:
-----------

- Support for /dev/mem, /dev/kmem and /dev/port removed, since OS support
  was limited to 32 bit Windows XP only.

- Added cygwin GetCommandLine wrappers which will allow Cygwin programs to
  (appear to) use the Windows command line functions.


Bug fixes:
----------

- Fix an off-by-one error in path handling which made the access check
  for the existing path before a ".." component (introduced with 1.7.21)
  fail for UNC paths (//server/share/path).
