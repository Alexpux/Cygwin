What's new:
-----------


What changed:
-------------

- Disable code which disallowed to start 32 bit Cygwin processes from 64 bit
  Cygwin processes and vice versa.  32 bit processes are not recognized as
  Cygwin processes by a 64 bit parent process and vice versa, so there is
  no IPC other than what you have with non-Cygwin processes.

- Redefine content of mtget tape info struct to allow fetching the number of
  partitions on a tape.


Bug fixes:
----------

- Fix creating two partitions on tape drives supporting initiator partitions.

- Update the internally used blocksize after setting a new blocksize for the
  current tape.
