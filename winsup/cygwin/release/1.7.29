What's new:
-----------

- Introduce reading passwd/group entries directly from SAM/AD, thus allowing
  to do without /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf
  file to configure passwd/group handling.

- Allow quoting of arguments to the CYGWIN environment variable, i.e.,
  set CYGWIN=error_start="c:\bin\someprogram -T"


What changed:

Bug Fixes
---------

- Try harder to do the right thing in the presence of console screen buffers,
  i.e., never clear the screen buffer unless the user asked for it.  Also
  fix screen escape sequences which attempted to scroll the screen.
