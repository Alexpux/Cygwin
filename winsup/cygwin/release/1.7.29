What's new:
-----------

- Introduce reading passwd/group entries directly from SAM/AD, thus allowing
  to do without /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf
  file to configure passwd/group handling.

- Allow quoting of arguments to the CYGWIN environment variable, i.e.,
  set CYGWIN=error_start="c:\bin\someprogram -T"
