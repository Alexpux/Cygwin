What's new:
-----------

- Introduce reading passwd/group entries directly from SAM/AD, thus allowing
  to do without /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf
  file to configure passwd/group handling.


What changed:
-------------

- Windows defines the IPV6_TCLASS option, but when using it in setsockopt
  it returns WSAENOPROTOOPT.  Cygwin now ignores this error condition and
  returns a fake success to the application, just as with IP_TOS for years.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Workaround a problem following native symlinks.
