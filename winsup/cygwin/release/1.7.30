What's new:
-----------

- Introduce reading passwd/group entries directly from SAM/AD, thus allowing
  to do without /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf
  file to configure passwd/group handling.


What changed:
-------------

- Windows defines the IPV6_TCLASS option, but when using it in setsockopt
  it returns WSAENOPROTOOPT.  Cygwin now ignores this error condition and
  returns a fake success to the application, just as with IP_TOS for years.

- Connect and sendto to the AF_INET and AF_INET6 ANY address is converted to
  the LOOPBACK address, as on Linux.

Bug Fixes

- Fix calls to readv/writev/recvmsg/sendmsg with 0 iovlen.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-04/msg00509.html

- Workaround a problem with Mingw64 Winsock headers which lead to an incorrect
  definition of struct sockaddr_in6, and which in turn broke /proc/net/if_inet6.

- Workaround a Winsock bug which neglects to set the SO_ERROR socket option
  when calling select on a dup'ed socket after an asynchronous connection
  attempt.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-04/msg00510.html

- Workaround the problem that getsockopt(IPPROTO_TCP,TCP_NODELAY) returns
  the option value as a 1 byte value, while BSD and Linux expect a 4 byte
  value.
