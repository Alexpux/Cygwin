/* Right now we implement flock(2) locks using the POSIX semantics
   in terms of inheritance and removal of locks.

   TODO: How to implement real BSD flock semantics?

	 From the Linux man page:

	 Locks created by flock() are associated with an open file table
	 entry.  This means that duplicate file descriptors (created by,
	 for example, fork(2) or dup(2)) refer to the same lock, and
	 this lock may be modified or released using any of these
	 descriptors.  Furthermore, the lock is released either by an
	 explicit LOCK_UN operation on any of these duplicate
	 descriptors, or when all such descriptors have been closed.

	 If a process uses open(2) (or similar) to obtain more than one
	 descriptor for the same file, these descriptors are treated
	 independently by flock().  An attempt to lock the file using
	 one of these file descriptors may be denied by a lock that the
	 calling process has already placed via another descriptor.  */
