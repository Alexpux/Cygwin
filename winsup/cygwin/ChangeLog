	model name.

2006-01-09  Christopher Faylor  <cgf@timesys.com>

	* spawn.cc (spawn_guts): Reorganize slightly so that 16 bit check is
	done prior to check for command.com/cmd.com.  Don't bother setting
	CREATE_SUSPENDED flag for a MS-DOS process since it doesn't work
	anyway.  Avoid calling remember() when the child process has already
	exited.
	(av::fixup): Explicitly set cygexec flag to false on a 16 bit process.

2006-01-09  Corinna Vinschen  <corinna@vinschen.de>

	station is already not visible.
	* spawn.cc (spawn_guts): Accommodate change of argument to
	set_console_state_for_spawn.

2006-01-05  Christopher Faylor  <cgf@timesys.com>

	* sigproc.cc (no_signals_available): Use existence of signal thread
	handle to figure out if we can actually send signals rather than
	relying on my_sendsig.
	(hwait_sig): Make static.
	(sigproc_init): Don't set my_sendsig to anything special.  Use new
	global static hwait_sig.
	(wait_sig): Set hwait_sig to NULL when we are exiting.

	lessen the likelihood of trying to deal with non-cygwin threads in
	dll_entry.

	* fhandler_console: Fix set_console_state_for_spawn comment.

2006-01-05  Igor Peshansky  <pechtcha@cs.nyu.edu>

	* spawn.cc (spawn_guts): Invert the argument to
	set_console_state_for_spawn.

2006-01-04  Christopher Faylor  <cgf@timesys.com>

	* fhandler_console.cc (fhandler_console::need_invisible): Only try to
	open "CygwinInvisible" windows station if opening of default station
	fails.  Use CloseWindowStation to close window station handle.

2006-01-04  Christopher Faylor  <cgf@timesys.com>

	* fhandler_console.cc (fhandler_console::need_invisible): Open up the
	security of the newly created windows station.

2006-01-03  Christopher Faylor  <cgf@timesys.com>

	* fhandler_console.cc (beep): Use MB_OK which is documented as using
	the default bell rather than -1 which seems to behave differently on
	different versions of Windows.

2006-01-03  Christopher Faylor  <cgf@timesys.com>

	* fhandler_process.cc (fhandler_process::readdir): Add missing argument
	to syscall_printf.

	* fhandler_console.cc (fhandler_console::need_invisible): Use made-up
	name for windows station rather than asking Windows to create one for

	* fhandler_console.cc (beep): Use a more Windows-generic wav file if
	the beep is missing.  Use a more foolproof way to find out whether we
	should be recreating the missing key.

	* registry.h (reg_key::_disposition): New field.
	(reg_key::created): New function.
	* registry.cc (reg_key::reg_key): Set _disposition to zero by default.
	(reg_key::build_key): Fill in _disposition field.

2006-01-03  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	* syslog.cc: Include sys/un.h instead of sys/socket.h.
	(syslogd_inited): Convert to enum type noting the exact result of
	trying to connect to syslog daemon.  Use this way throughout.

	connect to syslog socket.  Use correct struct sockaddr_un instead of
	struct sockaddr.
	(try_connect_syslogd): Call connect_syslogd.  If write fails on
	connection oriented socket, try to reconnect to syslog socket and
	try to write again.

2006-01-01  Christopher Faylor  <cgf@timesys.com>

	* pinfo.cc (pinfo::exit): Swap signal and normal exit value when not
	started from a cygwin process - just like the good-old-days of B20.
