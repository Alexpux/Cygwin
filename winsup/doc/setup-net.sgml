<sect1><title>Cygwin Contents</title>

<para>The following packages are included in the full release:</para>

<para>Development tools: binutils, bison, byacc, dejagnu, diff,
expect, flex, gas, gcc, gdb, itcl, ld, libstdc++, make, patch, tcl,
tix, tk</para>

<para>User tools: ash, bash, bzip2, diff, fileutils, findutils, gawk,
grep, gzip, less, m4, sed, shellutils, tar, textutils, time</para>

<para>The user tools release only contains the user tools.</para>

<para>Full source code is available for these tools.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="installing-binaries"><title>Installing the binary release</title>

<para>Important!  Be sure to remove any older versions of the Cygwin
tools from your <EnVar>PATH</EnVar> environment variable so you do
not execute them by mistake.</para>

<para>Connect to one of the ftp servers listed in
<ulink URL="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html">
http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html</ulink> and
<command>cd</command> to the directory containing the latest release.
</para>

<para>If you want the development tools and the programs necessary to
run the GNU configure mechanism, you should download the full binary
release called <filename>full.exe</filename>.  If you only care
about the user tools listed above, download
<filename>usertools.exe</filename> instead.</para>

<para>If you have an unreliable connection, download the appropriate
binary in smaller chunks instead.  For the split full installer, get
the files in the `full-split' subdirectory.  Once downloaded,
combine the split files at the command prompt by doing a:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt><userinput>copy /b xaa + xab + xac + ... + xak + xal full.exe</userinput>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt><userinput>del xa*.*</userinput>
</screen>

<para>A similar process can be used for the user tools.</para>

<para>Once you have installed the executable on your system, run
it.  First off, the installer will prompt you for a location to extract
the temporary files it needs to install the release on your
system. The default should be fine for most people.</para>

<para>Next it will ask you to choose an install location.  The default is
<filename><replaceable>system-drive</replaceable>:\cygnus\cygwin-b20</filename>.
Feel free to choose another location if you would prefer.</para>

<para>Finally, it will ask you for the name of the Program Files
folder shortcut to add.  By default, the installer will create a
`Cygwin B20' entry in a folder called `Cygnus Solutions'. When this
step is completed, it will install the tools and exit.</para>

<para>If you should ever want to uninstall the tools, you may do so
via the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel.</para>

<para> At this point you should be able to look under the start menu and
select "Cygwin Beta 20" (or whatever you named it). This will pop up a bash
shell with special environment variables set up for you. If you are running
Windows 95 or 98 and are faced with the error message "Out of environment
space", you need to increase the amount of environment space. Adding the
line <command>shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p</command> to the file
<filename>C:\CONFIG.SYS</filename> and then rebooting should do the trick if
<filename>C:</filename> is your system drive letter.</para>

<para>If you want to install the sources follow the
instructions in the next section, else go directly to 
<Xref LinkEnd="setup-dir"> to complete your system setup.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="installing-source"><title>Installing the source code</title>

<para>Before downloading the source code corresponding to the release,
you should install the latest release of the tools (either the full
release or just the user tools).</para>

<para>Create the directory that will house the source code. 
<command>cd</command> there.</para>

<para>Connect to one of the ftp servers listed above and
<command>cd</command> to the directory containing the latest release.
</para>

<para>The source code is split into two units: user tools and development
tools.  If you want the user tools source code, <command>cd</command> into
the <filename>user-src-split</filename> subdirectory.  Download the files
there.  If you want the development tools sources, <command>cd</command>
into the <filename>dev-src-split</filename> subdirectory.  Download the
files there.</para>

<para>Back in the Windows command shell, for the user tools
source:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>copy /b xba + xbb + xbc + xbd + xbe + xbf + xbg user-src.tar.bz2</userinput>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>del xb*.*</userinput>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>bunzip2 user-src.tar.bz2</userinput>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>tar xvf user-src.tar</userinput>
</screen>

<para>For the development tools source:</para>

<screen>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>copy /b xca + xcb + xcc + xcd + ... + xck + xcl dev-src.tar.bz2</userinput>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>del xc*.*</userinput>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>bunzip2 dev-src.tar.bz2</userinput>
<prompt>C:\Cygnus\&gt;</prompt> <userinput>tar xvf dev-src.tar</userinput>
</screen>

<para>Both will expand into a directory called
<filename>src</filename>.</para>

<para>Note: if you want the sources corresponding to everything in the
full.exe binary installer, you will need to download and expand both
the <filename>user-src.tar.bz2</filename> and
<filename>dev-src.tar.bz2</filename> source archives!</para>
