<question><para>How do I contribute a package?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>If you are willing to be a package maintainer, great!  We urgently need
volunteers to prepare and maintain packages, because the priority of the
Cygwin Team is Cygwin itself.
</para>
<para>The Cygwin Package Contributor's Guide at
<ulink url="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">http://cygwin.com/setup.html</ulink> details everything you need to know
about being a package maintainer. The quickest way to get started is to
read the <emphasis>Initial packaging procedure, script-based</emphasis> section on
that page.  The <literal>generic-build-script</literal> found there works well for
most packages. 
</para>
<para>For questions about package maintenance, use the cygwin-apps mailing
list (start at <ulink url="http://cygwin.com/lists.html">http://cygwin.com/lists.html</ulink>) <emphasis>after</emphasis>
searching and browsing the cygwin-apps list archives, of course.  Be
sure to look at the <emphasis>Submitting a package</emphasis> checklist at
<ulink url="http://cygwin.com/setup.html">http://cygwin.com/setup.html</ulink> before sending an ITP (Intent To
Package) email to cygwin-apps.

<para>You should also announce your intentions to the general cygwin list, in
case others were thinking the same thing.

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.huge-executables">
<question><para>Why are compiled executables so huge?!?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>By default, gcc compiles in all symbols.  You'll also find that gcc
creates large executables on UNIX.

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.glibc">
<question><para>Where is glibc?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin does not provide glibc.  It uses newlib instead, which provides
much (but not all) of the same functionality.  Porting glibc to Cygwin
would be difficult.

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.objective-c">
<question><para>Where is Objective C?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Objective C is not distributed with the Cygwin version of gcc, and there
are no plans to do so.  The gcc package maintainer had difficulty
building it, and once built there were problems using it.  It appears
that there is only minimal support for the Objective C front-end in the
main GCC distribution, anyway.

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.make-execvp">
<question><para>Why does my make fail on Cygwin with an execvp error? </para></question>
<answer>

<para>First of all, if you are using <literal>make -j[N]</literal>, then stop.  It doesn't
work well. Also beware of using non-portable shell features in your
Makefiles (see tips at <ulink 
url="http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.using.html#faq.using.shell-scripts" />).
</para>
<para>Errors of <literal>make: execvp: /bin/sh: Illegal Argument</literal> or 
<literal>make: execvp: /bin/sh: Argument list too long</literal> are often
caused by the command-line being to long for the Windows execution model.
To circumvent this, mount the path of the executable using the -X switch
to enable cygexec for all executables in that folder; you will also need
to exclude non-cygwin executables with the -x switch. Enabling cygexec
causes cygwin executables to talk directly to one another, which increases
the command-line limit. To enable cygexec for <literal>/bin</literal> and 
<literal>/usr/bin</literal>, you can use these commands in a batch file:
</para>
<screen>
mount -X -b -f c:\cygwin\bin /bin
mount -X -b -f c:\cygwin\bin /usr/bin
mount -x -b -f c:\cygwin\bin\tclsh84.exe /usr/bin/tclsh84.exe
mount -x -b -f c:\cygwin\bin\tclsh84.exe /bin/tclsh84.exe
mount -x -b -f c:\cygwin\bin\wish84.exe /usr/bin/wish84.exe
mount -x -b -f c:\cygwin\bin\wish84.exe /bin/wish84.exe
</screen>

<para>Note that if you have Tcl/Tk installed, you must specifically exclude 
<literal>tclsh84</literal> and <literal>wish84</literal>, which are linked 
to the Cygwin DLL but are not actually Cygwin programs. If you have added 
other non-Cygwin programs to a path you want to mount cygexec, you can find
them with a script like this:
</para>
<screen>
#!/bin/sh
cd /bin; for f in `find . -type f -name '*.exe'`; do
	cygcheck $f | (fgrep -qi cygwin1.dll || echo $f)
done
</screen>

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.win32-api">
<question><para>How do I use Win32 API calls?</para></question>
<answer>

<para><emphasis role='bold'>(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest net release.)</emphasis>
</para>
<para>It's pretty simple actually.  Cygwin tools require that you explicitly
link the import libraries for whatever Win32 API functions that you
are going to use, with the exception of kernel32, which is linked
automatically (because the startup and/or built-in code uses it).
</para>
<para>For example, to use graphics functions (GDI) you must link
with gdi32 like this:
</para>
<para>gcc -o foo.exe foo.o bar.o -lgdi32
</para>
<para>or (compiling and linking in one step):
</para>
<para>gcc -o foo.exe foo.c bar.c -lgdi32
</para>
<para>The following libraries are available for use in this way:
</para>
<para>advapi32  largeint  ole32     scrnsave  vfw32
cap       lz32      oleaut32  shell32   win32spl
comctl32  mapi32    oledlg    snmp      winmm
comdlg32  mfcuia32  olepro32  svrapi    winserve
ctl3d32   mgmtapi   opengl32  tapi32    winspool
dlcapi    mpr       penwin32  th32      winstrm
gdi32     msacm32   pkpd32    thunk32   wow32
glaux     nddeapi   rasapi32  url       wsock32
glu32     netapi32  rpcdce4   user32    wst
icmp      odbc32    rpcndr    uuid
imm32     odbccp32  rpcns4    vdmdbg
kernel32  oldnames  rpcrt4    version
</para>
<para>The regular setup allows you to use the option -mwindows on the
command line to include a set of the basic libraries (and also
make your program a GUI program instead of a console program),
including user32, gdi32 and, IIRC, comdlg32.
</para>
<para>Note that you should never include -lkernel32 on your link line
unless you are invoking ld directly.  Do not include the same import
library twice on your link line.  Finally, it is a good idea to
put import libraries last on your link line, or at least after
all the object files and static libraries that reference them.
</para>
<para>The first two are related to problems the linker has (as of b18 at least)
when import libraries are referenced twice.  Tables get messed up and
programs crash randomly.  The last point has to do with the fact that
gcc processes the files listed on the command line in sequence and
will only resolve references to libraries if they are given after
the file that makes the reference.

<question><para>How do I compile a Win32 executable that doesn't use Cygwin?</para></question>

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.static-linking">
<question><para>Can I build a Cygwin program that does not require cygwin1.dll at runtime?</para></question>

<para>No.  If your program uses the Cygwin API, then your executable cannot

statically link with a Cygwin library to obtain an independent,
self-contained executable.

<question><para>How do I use <literal>cygwin1.dll</literal> with Visual Studio or MinGW?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Before you begin, note that Cygwin is licensed under the GNU GPL (as
indeed are all other Cygwin-based libraries).  That means that if your
code links against the cygwin dll (and if your program is calling
functions from Cygwin, it must, as a matter of fact, be linked against
it), you must apply the GPL to your source as well.  Of course, this
only matters if you plan to distribute your program in binary form.  For
more information, see <ulink url="http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html</ulink>.  If
that is not a problem, read on.

<answer>

<para>First, you need to get the Cygwin source.  Ideally, you should check out

<emphasis>preferred method</emphasis> for acquiring the sources.  Otherwise, you can
install the cygwin source package from the distribution.
</para>
<para>If you are trying to duplicate a cygwin release then you should just
download the corresponding source package and use "tar xjf" to unpack
it.  This will unpack the sources into a directory named cygwin-x.y.z-n,
where x.y.z-n correspond to the version numbering of the tar.bz2
package.

<para>In this example, $(LD) is the linker, ld.
</para>
<para>$(DLLTOOL) is dlltool.
</para>
<para>$(AS) is the assembler, as.
</para>
<para>DLLNAME is the name of the DLL you want to create, e.g., tcl80.dll.
</para>
<para>OBJS is the list of object files you want to put into the DLL.
</para>
<para>LIBS is the list of libraries you want to link the DLL against.  For
example, you may or may not want -lcygwin.  You may want -lkernel32.
Tcl links against -lcygwin -ladvapi32 -luser32 -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32
-lkernel32.
</para>
<para>DEFFILE is the name of your definitions file.  A simple DEFFILE would
consist of ``EXPORTS'' followed by a list of all symbols which should
be exported from the DLL.  Each symbol should be on a line by itself.
Other programs will only be able to access the listed symbols.

<para>ENTRY is the name of the function which you want to use as the entry
point.  This function should be defined using the WINAPI attribute,
and should take three arguments:
        int WINAPI startup (HINSTANCE, DWORD, LPVOID)
</para>
<para>This means that the actual symbol name will have an appended @12, so if
your entry point really is named <literal>startup</literal>, the string you should
use for ENTRY in the above examples would be <literal>startup@12</literal>.
</para>
<para>If your DLL calls any Cygwin API functions, the entry function will need
to initialize the Cygwin impure pointer.  You can do that by declaring
a global variable <literal>_impure_ptr</literal>, and then initializing it in the
entry function.  Be careful not to export the global variable
<literal>_impure_ptr</literal> from your DLL; that is, do not put it in DEFFILE.

<para>You may put an optional `--subsystem windows' on the $(LD) lines.  The
Tcl build does this, but I admit that I no longer remember whether
this is important.  Note that if you specify a --subsytem &lt;x&gt; flag to ld,
the -e entry must come after the subsystem flag, since the subsystem flag
sets a different default entry point.
</para>
<para>You may put an optional `--image-base BASEADDR' on the $(LD) lines.
This will set the default image base.  Programs using this DLL will
start up a bit faster if each DLL occupies a different portion of the
address space.  Each DLL starts at the image base, and continues for
whatever size it occupies.
</para>
<para>Now that you've built your DLL, you may want to build a library so
that other programs can link against it.  This is not required: you
could always use the DLL via LoadLibrary.  However, if you want to be
able to link directly against the DLL, you need to create a library.
Do that like this:
</para>
<para>$(DLLTOOL) --as=$(AS) --dllname DLLNAME --def DEFFILE --output-lib LIBFILE
</para>
<para>$(DLLTOOL), $(AS), DLLNAME, and DEFFILE are the same as above.  Make
sure you use the same DLLNAME and DEFFILE, or things won't work right.
</para>
<para>LIBFILE is the name of the library you want to create, e.g.,
libtcl80.a.  You can then link against that library using something
like -ltcl80 in your linker command.

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.debug">
<question><para>How can I debug what's going on?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>You can debug your application using <literal>gdb</literal>.  Make sure you
compile it with the -g flag!  If your application calls functions in
MS DLLs, gdb will complain about not being able to load debug information
for them when you run your program.  This is normal since these DLLs
don't contain debugging information (and even if they did, that debug
info would not be compatible with gdb).

SIGINT may work, SIGFPE may work, SIGSEGV definitely does.  You cannot
'stop', 'print' or 'nopass' signals like SIGUSR1 or SIGHUP to the
process being debugged.

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.own-malloc">
<question><para>Can I use my own malloc?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>If you define a function called <literal>malloc</literal> in your own code, and link
with the DLL, the DLL <emphasis>will</emphasis> call your <literal>malloc</literal>.  Needless to
say, you will run into serious problems if your malloc is buggy.
</para>
<para>If you run any programs from the DOS command prompt, rather than from in
bash, the DLL will try and expand the wildcards on the command line.
This process uses <literal>malloc</literal> <emphasis>before</emphasis> your main line is started.
If you have written your own <literal>malloc</literal> to need some initialization
to occur after <literal>main</literal> is called, then this will surely break.
</para>
<para>Moreover, there is an outstanding issue with <literal>_malloc_r</literal> in
<literal>newlib</literal>.  This re-entrant version of <literal>malloc</literal> will be called
directly from within <literal>newlib</literal>, by-passing your custom version, and
is probably incompatible with it.  But it may not be possible to replace
<literal>_malloc_r</literal> too, because <literal>cygwin1.dll</literal> does not export it and
Cygwin does not expect your program to replace it.  This is really a
newlib issue, but we are open to suggestions on how to deal with it.

<question><para>Can I use the gdb debugger to debug programs built by VC++?</para></question>

<para>No, not for full (high level source language) debugging.
The Microsoft compilers generate a different type of debugging
symbol information, which gdb does not understand.
</para>
<para>However, the low-level (assembly-type) symbols generated by
Microsoft compilers are coff, which gdb DOES understand.
Therefore you should at least be able to see all of your

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.preprocessor">
<question><para>What preprocessor do I need to know about?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>We use _WIN32 to signify access to the Win32 API and __CYGWIN__ for
access to the Cygwin environment provided by the dll.
</para>
<para>We chose _WIN32 because this is what Microsoft defines in VC++ and
we thought it would be a good idea for compatibility with VC++ code
to follow their example.  We use _MFC_VER to indicate code that should
be compiled with VC++.
</para>
<para>_WIN32 is only defined when you use either the -mno-cygwin or -mwin32
gcc command line options.  This is because Cygwin is supposed to be a
Unix emulation environment and defining _WIN32 confuses some programs
which think that they have to make special concessions for a Windows
environment which Cygwin handles automatically.
</para>
<para>Note that using -mno-cygwin replaces __CYGWIN__ with __MINGW32__ as to
tell which compiler (or settings) you're running.
Check this out in detail by running, for example
</para>
<screen>
       $ gcc  -dM -E -xc /dev/null &gt;gcc.txt
       $ gcc -mno-cygwin -dM -E -xc /dev/null &gt;gcc-mno-cygwin.txt
       $ gcc -mwin32 -dM -E -xc /dev/null &gt;gcc-mwin32.txt

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.unix-gui">
<question><para>How should I port my Unix GUI to Windows?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>There are two basic strategies for porting Unix GUIs to Windows.
</para>
<para>The first is to use a portable graphics library such as tcl/tk, X11, or
V (and others?).  Typically, you will end up with a GUI on Windows that
requires some runtime support.  With tcl/tk, you'll want to include the
necessary library files and the tcl/tk DLLs.  In the case of X11, you'll
need everyone using your program to have an X11 server installed.
</para>
<para>The second method is to rewrite your GUI using Win32 API calls (or MFC
with VC++).  If your program is written in a fairly modular fashion, you
may still want to use Cygwin if your program contains a lot of shared
(non-GUI-related) code.  That way you still gain some of the portability
advantages inherent in using Cygwin.
</para>

<qandaentry id="faq.programming.djgpp">
<question><para>Why not use DJGPP ?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>DJGPP is a similar idea, but for DOS instead of Win32.  DJGPP uses a
"DOS extender" to provide a more reasonable operating interface for its
applications.   The Cygwin toolset doesn't have to do this since all of
the applications are native WIN32.   Applications compiled with the
Cygwin tools can access the Win32 API functions, so you can write
programs which use the Windows GUI.
