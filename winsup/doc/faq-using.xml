<question><para>Why can't my application locate cygncurses5.dll?  or cygintl.dll?  or cygreadline5.dll?  or ...?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>If you upgraded recently, and suddenly vim (or some other Cygwin
application) cannot find <literal>cygncurses5.dll</literal>, it probably means that you did
not follow these instructions properly:
<ulink url="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2001/msg00124.html">http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-announce/2001/msg00124.html</ulink>.  To
repair the damage, you must run Cygwin Setup again, and re-install the
<literal>libncurses5</literal> package.
</para>
<para>Note that Cygwin Setup won't show this option by default.  In the
``Select packages to install'' dialog, click on the <literal>Full/Part</literal>
button.  This lists all packages, even those that are already
installed.  Scroll down to locate the <literal>libncurses5</literal> package.
Click on the ``cycle'' glyph until it says ``Reinstall''.  Continue
with the installation.
</para>
<para>Similarly, if something cannot find <literal>cygintl.dll</literal>, then run
Cygwin Setup and re-install the <literal>libintl</literal> and <literal>libintl1</literal>
packages.
</para>

it to other missing DLLs (like cygreadline5.dll) and identify their

<qandaentry id="faq.using.slow">
<question><para>Why is Cygwin suddenly <emphasis>so</emphasis> slow?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>If you recently upgraded and suddenly <emphasis>every</emphasis> command takes a
<emphasis>very</emphasis> long time, then something is probably attempting to 
access a network share.  You may have the obsolete <literal>//c</literal>
notation in your PATH or startup files.  This now means the
<emphasis>network share</emphasis> <literal>c</literal>, which will slow things down
tremendously if it does not exist.  
</para>
<para>Using //c (for C:) doesn't work anymore.  (Similarly for any drive
letter, e.g. <literal>//z</literal> for <literal>Z:</literal>) This ``feature'' has long been
deprecated, and no longer works at all in the latest release.  As of
release 1.3.3, <literal>//c</literal> now means the <emphasis>network share</emphasis> <literal>c</literal>.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.services">
<question><para>Why don't my services work?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Most Windows services run as a special user called <literal>SYSTEM</literal>.  If you
installed Cygwin for "Just Me", the <literal>SYSTEM</literal> user won't see your
Cygwin mount table.  You need to re-mount all of your mounts as
"system" for services to work. You can re-run <literal>setup.exe</literal> and
select "Install for All Users", or this script will do the trick:

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.using.shares">
<question><para>Why can't my services access network shares?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>When a service switches to a certain user, it is running as 
<literal>SYSTEM</literal> impersonating the user account. During
impersonation, the user's password is not available and so non-public
network shares are not available.  For more information, see
<ulink url="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html" />.
</para>
<para>Workarounds include using public network share that does not require
authentication (for non-critical files), providing your password to a
<command>net use</command> command, or running the service as your own
user with <literal>cygrunsrv -u</literal> (see

<qandaentry id="faq.using.bashrc">
<question><para>Why doesn't bash read my .bashrc file on startup?</para></question>

<qandaentry id="faq.using.filename-spaces">
<question><para>Can I use paths/filenames containing spaces in them?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin does support spaces in filenames and paths.  That said, some
utilities that use the library may not, since files don't typically
contain spaces in Unix.  If you stumble into problems with this, you
will need to either fix the utilities or stop using spaces in filenames
used by Cygwin tools.
</para>
<para>In particular, bash interprets space as a word separator.  You would have
to quote a filename containing spaces, or escape the space character.
For example:
<screen>

<qandaentry id="faq.using.shortcuts">
<question><para>Why can't I cd into a shortcut to a directory?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin versions &lt; 1.3.0 do not follow MS Windows Explorer Shortcuts
(*.lnk files).  It sees a shortcut as a regular file and this you
cannot "cd" into it.
</para>
<para>Since version 1.3.0, Cygwin uses shortcuts as symlinks by default.
</para>
<para>Cygwin shortcuts are different from shortcuts created by native Windows
applications.  Windows applications can usually make use of Cygwin
shortcuts but not vice versa.  This is by choice.  The reason is that
Windows shortcuts may contain a bunch of extra information which would
get lost, if, for example, Cygwin tar archives and extracts them as
symlinks.
</para>
<para>Changing a Cygwin shortcut in Windows Explorer usually changes a Cygwin
shortcut into a Windows native shortcut.  Afterwards, Cygwin will not
recognize it as symlink anymore.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.find">
<question><para>I'm having basic problems with find.  Why?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Make sure you are using the find that came with Cygwin and that you
aren't picking up the Win32 find command instead.  You can verify that
you are getting the right one by doing a "type find" in bash.
</para>
<para>If the path argument to find, including current directory (default), is
itself a symbolic link, then find will not traverse it unless you
specify the <literal>-follow</literal> option.  This behavior is different than most
other UNIX implementations, but is not likely to change.
</para>
<para>If find does not seem to be producing enough results, or seems to be
missing out some directories, you may be experiencing a problem with one
of find's optimisations.  The absence of <literal>.</literal> and <literal>..</literal>
directories on some filesystems, such as DVD-R UDF, can confuse find.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.chmod">
<question><para>Why doesn't <literal>chmod</literal> work?</para></question>

<para>The most common case is that your <literal>/etc/passwd</literal>

<literal>ls -l</literal> shows a group of <literal>mkpasswd</literal>

<qandaentry id="faq.using.shell-scripts">
<question><para>Why doesn't my shell script work?</para></question>

<para>There are two basic problems you might run into.  One is the fact that

<command>bash-3.0-6</command>, <command>/bin/sh</command> was ash).  and is
missing some features you might expect in <command>/bin/sh</command>,

<command>zsh</command> (MacOS X "Panther") or <command>ksh</command> (Tru64).  
</para>

<para>Or, it could be a permission problem, and Cygwin doesn't understand that your script is executable.  Because <literal>chmod</literal> may not work (see FAQ entry above), Cygwin must read the contents of files to determine if
they are executable.  If your script does not start with
</para>
<screen>
	#! /bin/sh

<para>(or any path to a script interpreter, it does not have to be /bin/sh)

<para>also works.

<answer>

<para>You have some flexibility here.
</para>
<para>Cygwin has a builtin "cygdrive prefix" for drives that are not mounted.
You can access any drive, say Z:, as '/cygdrive/z/'.
</para>
<para>In some applications (notably bash), you can use the familiar windows
&lt;drive&gt;:/path/, using posix forward-slashes ('/') instead of Windows
backward-slashes ('\').  (But see the warning below!)  This maps in the
obvious way to the Windows path, but will be converted internally to use
the Cygwin path, following mounts (default or explicit).  For example:
<screen>
	bash$ cd C:/Windows
	bash$ pwd
        /cygdrive/c/Windows
</screen>
and
<screen>
	bash$ cd C:/cygwin
	bash$ pwd
        /
</screen>
for a default setup.  You could also use backward-slashes in the
Windows path, but these would have to be escaped from the shell.
</para>
<para><emphasis role='bold'>Warning:</emphasis> There is some ambiguity in going from a Windows path
to the posix path, because different posix paths, through different
mount points, could map to the same Windows directory.  This matters
because different mount points may be binmode or textmode, so the
behavior of Cygwin apps will vary depending on the posix path used to
get there.
</para>
<para>You can avoid the ambiguity of Windows paths, and avoid typing
"/cygdrive", by explicitly mounting drives to posix paths.  For example:
<screen>
	bash$ mkdir /c
	bash$ mount c:/ /c
	bash$ ls /c
</screen>
Then <literal>/cygdrive/c/Windows</literal> becomes <literal>/c/Windows</literal> which is a
little less typing.

<para>Note that you only need to mount drives once.  The mapping is kept
in the registry so mounts stay valid pretty much indefinitely.
You can only get rid of them with umount, or the registry editor.
</para>
<para>The '-b' option to mount mounts the mountpoint in binary mode
("binmode") where text and binary files are treated equivalently.  This
should only be necessary for badly ported Unix programs where binary
flags are missing from open calls.  It is also the setting for /,
/usr/bin and /usr/lib in a default Cygwin installation.  The default for
new mounts is text mode ("textmode"), which is also the mode for all
"cygdrive" mounts.

binmode or textmode using the <literal>mount</literal> command.  For example,

<answer>

<para>We have had good reports about Kerio Personal Firewall, ZoneLabs
Integrity Desktop, and the built-in firewall in Windows XP. Other
well-known products including ZoneAlarm and Norton Internet Security have

<para>On the whole, Cygwin doesn't care which firewall is used.  The few rare
exceptions have to do with socket code.
Cygwin uses sockets to implement many of its functions, such as IPC.
Some overzealous firewalls install themselves deeply into the winsock
stack (with the 'layered service provider' API) and install hooks
throughout.  Sadly the mailing list archives are littered with examples
of poorly written firewall-type software that causes things to break.
Note that with many of these products, simply disabling the firewall
does not remove these changes; it must be completely uninstalled.

<question><para>How can I share files between Unix and Windows?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>During development, we have both Linux boxes running Samba and Windows
machines.  We often build with cross-compilers under Linux and copy
binaries and source to the Windows system or just toy with them
directly off the Samba-mounted partition.  On dual-boot NT/Windows 9x
machines, we usually use the FAT filesystem so we can also access the
files under Windows 9x.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.case-sensitive">
<question><para>Is Cygwin case-sensitive? What are managed mounts?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Several Unix programs expect to be able to use to filenames
spelled the same way, but with different case.  A prime example
of this is perl's configuration script, which wants <literal>Makefile</literal> and
<literal>makefile</literal>.  WIN32 can't tell the difference between files with
just different case, so the configuration fails.
</para>
<para>To help with this problem, starting in <literal>cygwin-1.5.0</literal> it is
possible to have a case sensitive Cygwin managed mount. This is an
experimental feature and should be used with caution. You should only
use it for directories that are initially unpopulated and are due to
be completely managed by cygwin (hence the name).  So, the best use
would be to create an empty directory, mount it, and then add files to
it:  
</para>
<screen>
mkdir /managed-dir
mount -o managed c:/cygwin/managed-dir /managed-dir
cd /managed-dir/
touch makefile
touch Makefile

<question><para>What about DOS special filenames?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Files cannot be named com1, lpt1, or aux (to name a few); either as
the root filename or as the extension part.  If you do, you'll have
trouble.  Unix programs don't avoid these names which can make things
interesting.  E.g., the perl distribution has a file called
<literal>aux.sh</literal>.  The perl configuration tries to make sure that
<literal>aux.sh</literal> is there, but an operation on a file with the magic
letters 'aux' in it will hang.

<question><para>When it hangs, how do I get it back?</para></question>

return to bash or the cmd prompt.

<answer>

<para>Why do /lib and /usr/lib (and /bin, /usr/bin) point to the same thing?
</para>
<para>Why use mounts instead of symbolic links?
</para>
<para>Can I use a disk root (e.g., C:\) as Cygwin root?  Why is this discouraged?
</para>
<para>After a new installation in the default location, your mount points will
look something like this:
</para>
<screen>
	bash$ mount
	C:\cygwin\bin on /usr/bin type system (binmode)
	C:\cygwin\lib on /usr/lib type system (binmode)
	C:\cygwin on / type system (binmode)
</screen>

<para>(Exactly what you see depends on what options you gave to <literal>setup.exe</literal>.)
</para>
<para>Note that /bin and /usr/bin point to the same location, as do /lib and
/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you <emphasis>really</emphasis> know what you are doing.
</para>
<para>Various applications and packages may expect to be installed in /lib or
/usr/lib (similarly /bin or /usr/bin).  Rather than distinguish between
them and try to keep track of them (possibly requiring the occasional
duplication or symbolic link), it was decided to maintain only one
actual directory, with equivalent ways to access it.
</para>
<para>Symbolic links had been considered for this purpose, but were dismissed
because they do not always work on Samba drives.  Also, mounts are
faster to process because no disk access is required to resolve them.
</para>
<para>Note that non-cygwin applications will not observe Cygwin mounts (or
symlinks for that matter).  For example, if you use WinZip to unpack the
tar distribution of a Cygwin package, it may not get installed to the
correct Cygwin path.  <emphasis>So don't do this!</emphasis>
</para>
<para>It is strongly recommended not to make the Cygwin root directory the
same as your drive's root directory, unless you know what you are doing
and are prepared to deal with the consequences.  It is generally easier
to maintain the Cygwin hierarchy if it is isolated from, say, C:\.  For
one thing, you avoid possible collisions with other (non-cygwin)
applications that may create (for example) \bin and \lib directories.
(Maybe you have nothing like that installed now, but who knows about
things you might add in the future?)

<qandaentry id="faq.using.anti-virus">
<question><para>How do anti-virus programs like Cygwin?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Users have reported that NAI (formerly McAfee) VirusScan for NT (and
others?) is incompatible with Cygwin.  This is because it tries to scan
the newly loaded shared memory in cygwin1.dll, which can cause fork() to
fail, wreaking havoc on many of the tools.  (It is not confirmed that
this is still a problem, however.)
</para>
<para>There have been several reports of NAI VirusScan causing the system to
hang when unpacking tar.gz archives.  This is surely a bug in VirusScan,
and should be reported to NAI.  The only workaround is to disable
VirusScan when accessing these files.  This can be an issue during
setup, and is discussed in that FAQ entry.
</para>
<para>Some users report a significant performance hit using Cygwin when their
anti-virus software is enabled.  Rather than disable the anti-virus
software completely, it may be possible to specify directories whose
contents are exempt from scanning.  In a default installation, this
would be <literal>C:\cygwin\bin</literal>.  Obviously, this could be
exploited by a hostile non-Cygwin program, so do this at your own risk.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.ntemacs">
<question><para>What about NT Emacs?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>If you want GNU Emacs with a native Microsoft Windows interface, but
without X, then you must use the native Windows port, commonly known
as ``NT Emacs''.  You get NT Emacs from any GNU mirror.  It is not
available from Cygwin Setup.
</para>
<para>NT Emacs uses the Windows command shell by default.  Since it is not a
Cygwin application, it has no knowledge of Cygwin mounts.  With those
points in mind, you need to add the following code to your ~/.emacs
(or ~/_emacs) file in order to use Cygwin bash.  This is particularly useful
for the JDEE package (<ulink url="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">http://jdee.sunsite.dk/</ulink>).  The following
settings are for Emacs 21.1:
</para>
<screen>
	;; This assumes that Cygwin is installed in C:\cygwin (the
	;; default) and that C:\cygwin\bin is not already in your
	;; Windows Path (it generally should not be).
	;;
	(setq exec-path (cons "C:/cygwin/bin" exec-path))
	(setenv "PATH" (concat "C:\\cygwin\\bin;" (getenv "PATH")))
	;;
	;; NT-emacs assumes a Windows command shell, which you change
	;; here.
	;;
	(setq shell-file-name "bash")
	(setenv "SHELL" shell-file-name) 
	(setq explicit-shell-file-name shell-file-name)

	;; This removes unsightly ^M characters that would otherwise
	;; appear in the output of java applications.

<para>Yes!  Use rxvt instead.  It's an optional package in Cygwin Setup.
You can use it with or without X11.  You can resize it easily by
dragging an edge or corner.  Copy and paste is easy with the left and
middle mouse buttons, respectively.  It will honor settings in your
~/.Xdefaults file, even without X.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.info-error">
<question><para>info error "dir: No such file or directory"</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin packages install their info documentation in the
<literal>/usr/share/info</literal> directory.  But you need to create a <literal>dir</literal>
file there before the standalone info program (probably
<literal>/usr/bin/info</literal>) can be used to read those info files.  This is how
you do it:
<screen>
	bash$ cd /usr/share/info
	bash$ for f in *.info ; do install-info $f dir ; done
</screen>
This may generate warnings:
<screen>
	install-info: warning: no info dir entry in `gzip.info'
	install-info: warning: no info dir entry in `time.info'
</screen>
The <literal>install-info</literal> command cannot parse these files, so you will
have to add their entries to <literal>/usr/share/info/dir</literal> by hand.

you install new Cygwin packages.  Some packages update the dir file
for you, but many don't.

<qandaentry id="faq.using.out-of-queue">
<question><para>Why do I get a message saying Out of Queue slots?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>"Out of queue slots!" generally occurs when you're trying to remove
many files that you do not have permission to remove (either because
you don't have permission, they are opened exclusively, etc).  What
happens is Cygwin queues up these files with the supposition that it
will be possible to delete these files in the future.  Assuming that
the permission of an affected file does change later on, the file will
be deleted as requested.  However, if too many requests come in to
delete inaccessible files, the queue overflows and you get the message
you're asking about.  Usually you can remedy this with a quick chmod,
close of a file, or other such thing.  (Thanks to Larry Hall for
this explanation).
