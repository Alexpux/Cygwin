<sect1 id="installing-binaries"><title>Installing the binary release</title>

<para>Load the GNUPro CD-ROM and run the installer.  It will
take you through the installation process, starting with asking for
your install location.  Once the installation is complete, there will
be a new Program Files folder that you can use to obtain a shell
from which you can run the tools.</para>

<para>There are two remaining thing you should do from this
prompt. First, you need to type <command>mkdir -p /tmp</command> to
ensure that a temp directory exists for programs that expect to find
one there.</para>

<para>Second, depending on how you intend to use the tools, various
programs may need to be able to find `/bin/sh'. You should `mkdir -p
/bin' and put a copy of `sh.exe' there, removing the older version, if
present.  Note that you can use the `mount' utility to select which
drive letter is mounted as `/'.</para>

<para>If you should ever want to uninstall the tools, you may do so
via the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel.</para>
