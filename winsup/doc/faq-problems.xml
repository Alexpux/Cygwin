<question><para>Hangs with Hyperthreaded Processor</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Some users using processors with Intel's Hyperthreading turned on have
reported hangs that do not appear with Hyperthreading off. So far
the Cygwin developers have not been able to reproduce this problem.
See <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-07/msg01100.html">http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-07/msg01100.html</ulink> and
related messages for details.

<question><para>Pipe key (<literal>|</literal>) doesn't work on non-US keyboards in Win9x/ME</para></question>
<answer>

<para>This might get fixed someday, but meanwhile, just use rxvt, which does
not have this problem.  This is no real loss, because rxvt has many
other advantages.  (Do not attempt to use the "broken" pipe key
(<literal>&brokenpipe;</literal>) as a substitute, it is a different character.)
