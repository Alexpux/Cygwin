<question><para>Where's the documentation?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>If you have installed Cygwin, you can find lots of documentation in
<literal>/usr/share/doc/</literal>.  Some packages have Cygwin specific
instructions in a file
<literal>/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/<replaceable>package_name</replaceable>.README</literal>.
In addition, many packages ship with standard documentation, which you can
find in
<literal>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package_name</replaceable></literal> or
by using the <literal>man</literal> or <literal>info</literal> tools. (Hint:
use <literal>cygcheck -l <replaceable>package_name</replaceable></literal> to
list what man pages the package includes.)  Some older packages still keep
their documentation in <literal>/usr/doc/</literal>
instead of <literal>/usr/share/doc/</literal>.
</para>
<para>There are links to quite a lot of documentation on the main Cygwin
project web page, <ulink url="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</ulink>,
including this FAQ.  Be sure to at least read any 'Release Notes' or 'Readme'
or 'read this' links on the main web page, if there are any.
</para>
<para>There is a comprehensive Cygwin User's Guide at <ulink
url="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html</ulink>
and an API Reference at <ulink
url="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html</ulink>.
</para>
<para>You can find documentation for the individual GNU tools at <ulink
url="http://www.fsf.org/manual/">http://www.fsf.org/manual/</ulink>.  (You
should read GNU manuals from a local mirror, check <ulink
url="http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html">http://www.fsf.org/server/list-mirrors.html</ulink>
for a list of them.)

<question><para>What Cygwin mailing lists can I join?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Comprehensive information about the Cygwin mailing lists can be found at
<ulink url="http://cygwin.com/lists.html">http://cygwin.com/lists.html</ulink>.
</para>
<para>To subscribe to the main list, send a message to
cygwin-subscribe@cygwin.com.  To unsubscribe from the 
main list, send a message to cygwin-unsubscribe@cygwin.com.
In both cases, the subject and body of the message are ignored.
</para>
<para>Similarly, to subscribe to the Cygwin announcements list, send a message
to cygwin-announce-subscribe@cygwin.com.  To unsubscribe,
send a message to cygwin-announce-unsubscribe@cygwin.com.
</para>
<para>If you want to contribe to Cygwin tools &amp; applications, rather than
the library itself, then you should subscribe to cygwin-apps. There
is also a low-volume list called cygwin-developers which is reserved
for knowledgeable people who regularly contribute to the Cygwin DLL.
Please do not ask for read-only access to this mailing list.  Both
cygwin-developers and cygwin-apps are by-approval lists.  The same
mechanism as described for the first two lists works for these as
well.  
</para>
<para>There is a searchable archive of the main mailing list at
<ulink url="http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/">http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/</ulink>.  There is an alternate
archive, also searchable, at <ulink url="http://www.delorie.com/archives/">http://www.delorie.com/archives/</ulink>.
You can also search at <ulink url="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</ulink> and include
"cygwin" in the list of search terms.
</para>
<para>Cygwin mailing lists are not gatewayed to USENET, so anti-spam measures
in your email address are neither required nor appreciated.  Also, avoid
sending HTML content to Cygwin mailing lists.

<qandaentry id="faq.resources.posting">
<question><para>Posting Guidelines (Or: Why won't you/the mailing list answer my questions?)</para></question>
<answer>

<para>If you follow these guidelines, you are much more likely to get a
helpful response from the Cygwin developers and/or the Cygwin community at
large:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem><para>Read the User's Guide and the FAQ first.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Check the mailing list archives.  Your topic may have come up
before.  (It may even have been answered!)  Use the search facilities
at the links above.  Try the alternate site if the main archive is not
producing search results.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Explain your problem carefully and completely.  "I installed Blah
and it doesn't work!" wastes everybody's time.  It provides no
information for anyone to help you with your problem.  You should
provide:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem><para>A problem statement:  How does it behave, how do you think it
should behave, and what makes you think it's broken?  (Oh yeah, and what
is <emphasis>"it"</emphasis>?)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Information about your Windows OS ("Win95 OSR2" or "NT4/SP3" or
"Win2K" or "Win98 SE" or ...).
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Details about your installation process, or attempts at same.  (Internet or
Directory install?  If the former, exactly when and from what mirror?
If the latter, which packages did you download?  Which version of
setup.exe?  Any subsequent updates?)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Details about your Cygwin setup, accomplished by <emphasis>attaching</emphasis>
the output of 'cygcheck -s -v -r' to your message.  (Do not paste the
output into your message.)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A valid return address, so that a reply doesn't require manual editing of
the 'To:' header.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</listitem>
<listitem><para>Your message must be relevant to the list.  Messages that are
<emphasis>not</emphasis> directly related to Cygwin are considered off-topic and are
unwelcome.  For example, the following are off-topic:
</para>
<itemizedlist><listitem><para>General programming language questions
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>General Windows programming questions

<listitem><para>General UNIX shell programming questions

<para>If you do not follow the above guidelines, you may still elicit a
response, but you may not appreciate it!

nobody knows the answer.
