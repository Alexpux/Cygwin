@section Linking with -lm or -lc leads to crash

Currently, @code{/usr/lib/libm.a} and @code{/usr/lib/libc.a} are
symbolic links to libcygwin.a, where this stuff is actually implemented.
You need not explicitly link with -lm or -lc.

In fact, you @strong{must not} link with -lm or -lc, or your application
will crash.  This is a bug, and it is being worked on.

Providing empty stub libraries for libm.a and libc.a is not considered
workable, because some packages look for symbols there.

There are some discussions of this in the mailing list.  See

This is a bug in the Cygwin pty code.  It should be fixed in the next
