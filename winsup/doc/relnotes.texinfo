@section Linking with -lm or -lc leads to crash

Currently, @code{/usr/lib/libm.a} and @code{/usr/lib/libc.a} are
symbolic links to libcygwin.a, where this stuff is actually implemented.
You need not explicitly link with -lm or -lc.

In fact, you @strong{must not} link with -lm or -lc, or your application
will crash.  This is a bug, and it is being worked on.

Providing empty stub libraries for libm.a and libc.a is not considered
workable, because some packages look for symbols there.

There are some discussions of this in the mailing list.  See

@section Ctrl-S hangs rxvt and xterm

This is a bug in the Cygwin pty code.  It should be fixed in the next
release.

@section dllwrap is broken

Any invocation of dllwrap results in the error

@code{/usr/bin/ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol __cygwin_dll_entry@@12}

This should be fixed in the next release.  For details and a workaround,
see
