cygload demonstrates how to dynamically load cygwin1.dll.  The default
build uses MinGW to compile it; the Makefile also shows how to build
it using the Microsoft compiler.

By default, the program will silently test basic functionality:
        * Making space on the stack for cygtls
        * Loading and initializing cygwin1.dll
        * Path translation
        * Error handling
        * Signal handling

Command line parameters are:

    -v                 Verbose output
    -testinterrupts    Pause for 30 seconds to allow testing command line
                       interrupts (^C)
    -cygwin xxx        Specifies an alternative DLL to load instead of
                       cygwin1.dll.
