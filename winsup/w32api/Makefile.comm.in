# Rules for rebuilding makefiles in sub-directories:
#
# Each of these should be rebuilt when its own Makefile.in is modified,
# or when ${top_builddir}/config.status is updated.  Rebuilding is achieved
# by running ${top_builddir}/config.status, with ${top_builddir} as CWD; as
# a side effect this also rebuilds all other makefiles in the package tree.
# In particular, it causes ${top_builddir}/Makefile.comm.in to be rebuilt,
# BEFORE any sub-directory specific Makefile is updated.
#
# Since ${top_builddir}/Makefile.comm is also required by each individual
# sub-directory Makefile, and since all sub-directory makefiles are ALWAYS
# updated along with ${top_builddir}/Makefile.comm, we may simply declare
# the dependency...
#
Makefile: ${top_builddir}/Makefile.comm

# ...then by adding Makefile.in as an artificial prerequisite of this,
# together with its own real dependence on ${top_builddir}/config.status
# and ${top_srcdir}/Makefile.comm.in, we can simply rely on the mutually
# effective rebuilding side effects to update both the subdirectory's own
# Makefile, and ${top_builddir}/Makefile.comm, in a single operation.
#
${top_builddir}/Makefile.comm: ${top_builddir}/config.status
${top_builddir}/Makefile.comm: Makefile.in ${top_srcdir}/Makefile.comm.in
	cd ${top_builddir} && $(SHELL) config.status

# ${top_builddir}/config.status must itself be updated, at any time when
# ${top_srcdir}/configure has been modified; this is a distinct operation
# from the rebuilding of makefiles.
#
${top_builddir}/config.status: ${top_srcdir}/configure
	cd ${top_builddir} && $(SHELL) config.status --recheck
