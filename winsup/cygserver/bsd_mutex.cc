 * runnable with the specified priority.  Sleeps at most timo/hz seconds
 * (0 means no timeout).  If pri includes PCATCH flag, signals are checked
 * before and after sleeping, else signals are not checked.  Returns 0 if
 * awakened, EWOULDBLOCK if the timeout expires.  If PCATCH is set and a
 * signal needs to be delivered, ERESTART is returned if the current system
 * call should be restarted if possible, and EINTR is returned if the system
 * call should be interrupted by the signal (return EINTR).
 *
 * The mutex argument is exited before the caller is suspended, and
 * entered before msleep returns.  If priority includes the PDROP
 * flag the mutex is not entered before returning.
