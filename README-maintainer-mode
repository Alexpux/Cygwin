Note that if you configure with --enable-maintainer-mode, you will need
special versions of automake, autoconf, libtool and gettext. You will
find the sources for these in ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/binutils.

Note - "make distclean" does not work with maintainer mode enabled.
The Makefiles in the some of the po/ subdirectories depend upon the
Makefiles in their parent directories, and distclean will delete the
Makefiles in the parent directories before running the Makefiles in
the child directories.  There is no easy way around this (short of
changing the automake macros) as these dependencies need to exist in
order to correctly build the NLS files.
